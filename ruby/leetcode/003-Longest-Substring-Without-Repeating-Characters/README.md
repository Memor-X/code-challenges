Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = "abcabcbb"<br>
> **Output:** 3<br>
> **Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.


**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = "bbbbb"<br>
> **Output:** 1<br>
> **Explanation:** The answer is "b", with the length of 1.


**Example 3:**

> **Input:** s = "pwwkew"<br>
> **Output:** 3<br>
> **Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

**Constraints:**

- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
